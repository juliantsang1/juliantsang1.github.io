### [Case Study: Is there a relationship between playground availability and household income in New York City?](https://github.com/juliantsang1/juliantsang1.github.io/blob/master/NYC-Income-Playgrounds/IncomeVsPlayground%20-%20Final-revised.ipynb)
Using datasets provided by the IRS and NYC Open Data, I attempt to investigate whether household income has any relationship with playground and park availability in New York City. Using the folium library, I create an interactive map with multiple overlays illustrating the distribution of income, playgrounds, and park density according to zip codes.

### [San Francisco Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/juliantsang1/juliantsang1.github.io/blob/master/SF%20Bikeshare/Project_1.ipynb)
Using Google BigQuery public datasets, I perform some exploratoy analysis into Lyft's BayWheels Bikesharing Program. Afterwards, I describe some business recommendations that could be used to improve the service.
