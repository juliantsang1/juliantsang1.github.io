### [Diagnosing Pneumonia from Chest X-Rays](https://github.com/juliantsang1/Pneumonia_XRays/blob/master/W207_Final_Project_Kaggle_compatability_v2_Apples_to_Apples.ipynb)
Using convolutional neural networks, we attempt to create a multi-class classifier that would be able to identify whether a given image of a chest x-ray is normal or has bacterial or viral pneumonia.

### [Case Study: Is there a relationship between playground availability and household income in New York City?](https://github.com/juliantsang1/NYCIncomePlaygrounds/blob/master/IncomeVsPlayground%20-%20Final-revised.ipynb)
Using datasets provided by the IRS and NYC Open Data, I attempt to investigate whether household income has any relationship with playground and park availability in New York City. Using the folium library, I create an interactive map with multiple overlays illustrating the distribution of income, playgrounds, and park density according to zip codes.

### [San Francisco Bike Sharing Analysis](https://github.com/juliantsang1/SFBikeshare/blob/master/Project_1.ipynb)
Using Google BigQuery public datasets, I perform some exploratory analysis into Lyft's BayWheels Bikesharing Program. Afterwards, I describe some business recommendations that could be used to improve the service.
