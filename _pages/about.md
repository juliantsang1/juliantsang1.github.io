I work as a Data Scientist at a financial services company, driving strategy and decision-making in Corporate Finance. I adjust and build corporate forecasts. 

Previously, I was an Operations Analyst at a healthcare advertising agency, communicating insights through data visualizations regarding resourcing needs, agency finances, and project management.  

I graduated from UC Berkeley's Data Science program, where I developed the skills in machine learning and statistical techniques to apply towards interesting problems.
