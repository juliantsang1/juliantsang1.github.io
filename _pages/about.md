I work as an Operations Analyst at a healthcare advertising agency, communicating insights through data visualizations regarding resourcing and project management.  

At night, I'm a Master's student enrolled in UC Berkeley's Data Science program, continually developing new skills in machine learning and statistics and applying them to interesting problems.
