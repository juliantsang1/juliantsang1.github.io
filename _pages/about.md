I currently work as a Data Scientist at a financial services company, driving corporate finance strategy and decision-making. In my role, I highlight spend patterns, create visualizations to help explain current trends, and offer recommendations to course-adjust within the context of financial planning and analysis. I also develop machine learning models that predict future performance for corporate clients, providing insight into the performance of various segments and industries and how clients are expected to navigate their way beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

Previously, I was an Operations Analyst at a healthcare advertising agency, communicating insights through data visualizations regarding resourcing needs, agency finances, and project management scoping.  

I graduated from UC Berkeley's Data Science program, where I developed the skills in machine learning and statistical techniques to apply towards interesting problems.
