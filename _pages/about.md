I work as an Operations Analyst at a healthcare advertising agency, communicating insights through data visualizations regarding resourcing needs, agency finances, and project management.  

During the evenings, I'm a Master's student enrolled in UC Berkeley's Data Science program, continually developing new skills in machine learning and statistical techniques in order to apply them towards interesting problems.
